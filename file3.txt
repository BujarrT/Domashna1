Sizeable Sardinia, west of Italy, is an insular world unto itself,
with high mountains, rushing rivers, great golden plains,
historical cities and a cuisine and culture quite distinct from the mainland.
The finest towns are probably Bosa, Atzara and Cagliari (check the flamingos).
The finest beaches (watch for crowds in summer) are Cala Gonone, Cala Luna ...
The best local foods, on an island obsessed with eating,
are suckling pig, seafood fregula, spaghetti with sea urchin, lamb with artichokes
